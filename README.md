Module 15 challenge

This module challenge requires creating a map to show earthquakes that occured in the past 7 days. The data was obtained from the USGS-https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson. It provides earthquake data in a geojson format, updated every 5 minutes. 

The imported data was then visualized by doing the following:

  1. Using Leaflet, a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude was created.

2. Data markers were created to  reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

3. Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked created.

4. A legend that provides context for the map data created.

The code is saved within the logic.js file found within the static folder under leaflet 1.
The index.html file is saved within the leaflet 1 folder.
